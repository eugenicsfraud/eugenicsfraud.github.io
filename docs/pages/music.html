                <p>I used to play quite a few instruments, but those three have been the only ones that stuck for a while. Take a look!</p>

                    <p>I have been forced to play flute as a child. It lasted for 3 years and I never liked it. I can still play a mean tune, though.</p>
                    <p>The piano has been my greatest love. I discovered it at the age of 12 and never stopped playing. You can listen to my favourite tune to perform <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=49yeVcx4_gCMPidh"> here</a>.</p>
                    <p>The guitar and I were not made to last. I learned how to play 'Country Roads, Take me Home' just after finishing Fallout 4, but that was the end of it.</p>
