    "description": "It is my greatest regret. My first creations were nothing special, and had many holes. But, with time, I got better. Unfortunately, I got to close to the sun and my ambitions were my doom. I gave up on knitting after deciding I'd make a jumper. Still haven't started it, it's been 5 months since I gathered the necessary equipement. Where is it now? Your guess is as good as my own."
